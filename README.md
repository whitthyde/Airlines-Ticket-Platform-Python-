# Airlines-Ticket-Platform-Python-
Built an idle console platform for customers to buy tickets for airplane, view their travel reservations, update their reservation, view a seat map, change their seat, etc. 

This project was my final for an object oriented programming class centered around python. If you have any questions, or cannot seem to open the file please email whyde@utexas.edu and I will gladly help you.

This project was completed and turned in the FALL 2017 semester.
